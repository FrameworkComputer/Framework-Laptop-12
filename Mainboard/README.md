## Fan Interface

Hefeng AWA02-S04FIA-HF connector for the Fan.  Note that there are many other footprint
compatible 4-pin connectors that are likely compatible. This kind of connector is also known
as "JST SH", and has a 1.0 mm pitch. The same connector is used for the Speakers.

Pin 1 is further away from the speaker assembly.

| 2   | FAN_SPEED |
| 3   | FAN_PWM   |
| 4   | GND       |

## RTC Battery Interface

NOTE: The mainboard will charge this battery, so a rechargable ML1220 battery must be used.
CR2032 is not okay because it cannot be charged.

Settings are kept alive by the normal system battery. The only case where an
RTC battery is needed, is when the system is used in standalone mode (without a battery).

Cvilux CVILU_CI4402M1HRC-NH connector for the RTC Battery.

| Pin | Signal    | Location |
|-----|-----------|----------|
| 1   | +RTCBATT  | Left     |
| 2   | GND       | Right    |
