# Framework Laptop 12
Documentation around the Mainboard and other key parts of Framework Laptop 12 
(available at https://frame.work/marketplace/mainboards).

We designed Framework Laptop 12 to enable re-use of key modules like the Mainboard.
The Mainboard is operable as a standalone single board computer outside of the laptop,
with a smaller form factor relative to Framework Laptop 13.
